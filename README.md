# gwas
This project aims to create a Python script that can be used directly on files downloaded from the GWAS Catalog website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).
The goal of the tool available here (gwas.py) is to return quick analysis results as the output based on an input consisting of a given GWAS Catalog file.
Key statistics intended to be included in these results include the number and percent of reported associations that are consistent, replicated, or statistically significant below a given p-value threshold.
